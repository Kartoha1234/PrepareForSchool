# PrepareForSchool
INTRODUCTION
	In the academic year 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 (during Covid-19 pandemic) in many cities and municipalities of Latvia remote learning for some age groups was carried out for the several month in a row. In that time teachers, pupils and parents acknowledged that organizing their daily lives independently and planning learning process is one of the most difficult tasks.
	One of problem what raised was: how to collect all information about the homeworkâ€™s for primary school pupils when teachers were using different communication resources (e.g. mykoob.lv, uzdevumi.lv, MyTeams, WhatsUpp, printed pages what children had collect in schools) and this information was given during all daytime.
	One of the team member is a mom of two primary school children and she went througt all the struggling what remote learnig brought. So team created PrepareForScool app where teachers and parents can register all homeworks so their primary school children could prepare for school or prepare home works for next day independently. 

HOW IT WORKS

Insertion:
1. Homeworks in app PrepareForSchool in simple steps  are registered by teachers (in this case we used already prepared SQL data base)
2. Homeworks in  PrepareForSchool are registered by pearent if he received an information in any other resource

Read:

1. Children choosing the specific day can see the list of lessonts for that day

DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES
	As the project is final work for Java learning courses for 3 month, there is lot of space to develop this app in future:
1. Need to finish Child scenario where he choosing specific day can see the list of homeworks for that day
2. It would be grate to add a fields for extra scool activities: excursions (what to take with for going in excursions, boat rides ectr.), competitions (e.g. prepare for local biology competition), exhibitions (e.g. prepare something for autumn delicacy exhibition)
3. Can add extracurricular activities: art school, music school, sports training, ectr.

USED PROGRAMS
1. Programm are created in programming language JAVA
2. Was used SQL database
3. Used project managing tool Trello 
4. For code storing, managing and tracking changes was used GIT repository
